# ear.js-model

These are the official model files for ear.js. This model is based on the yolo-v5s architecture and retrained to detect ears. 

However, this model is far from done; it was only trained on pictures of me(with the intent of using a dataset like celeb-faces or something later), so the model will not work on everyone. 

Don't expect optimal performance right now, especially if you look different than I do. I will update these files once I retrained my model on a more diverse set of faces.
